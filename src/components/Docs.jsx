                        Welcome fellow programmers or soon-to-be programmers!
                        This guide aims to thoroughly explain how TEPL works.
                        TEPL is a basic programming language with many features
                        designed to teach the basic concepts of programming. It
                        is especially useful for beginners and teachers looking
                        to introduce programming in a clear and simple manner.

                    <h3>When will TEPL be ready to use?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We aim to have TEPL ready by the end of 2024 or possibly
                        sooner. Currently, we are building the base syntax and
                        will move on to more advanced functionalities and
                        important features. Libraries and frameworks will also
                        be added in the future.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why use TEPL?</h3>
                    <p>
                        TEPL is designed for beginners and focuses on backend
                        development. Although it currently lacks frontend
                        features, we plan to introduce VEPL (Visually
                        Educational Programming Language) for frontend
                        development. TEPL uses simple and English-like grammar,
                        making it easy for beginners to learn.

                        change, but the idea of functions will be introduced
                        later on.)
